I'm a third year graduate student from [School of Biology](https://sls.westlake.edu.cn/About/Overview/), [Westlake University](https://westlake.edu.cn/). My research interest includes epigenetics in cancer.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanxiao ZHANG](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yanxiao-zhang.html) of [Computational and Fuctional Genomics Lab](https://zhangyxlab.github.io/) from [Westlake University](https://westlake.edu.cn/).

Accompanied by a cat named "Todo(土豆)"

On spare time, I am a lover of photography and rock music.
