I'm a third year graduate student from <a href="https://sls.westlake.edu.cn/en/About/Overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Biology</a>, <a href="https://en.westlake.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westlake University</a>. My research interest includes epigenetics in cancer.

I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yanxiao-zhang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Yanxiao ZHANG</a> of <a href="https://zhangyxlab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational and Functional Genomics Lab</a> from Westlake University.

Accompanied by a cat named "Todo(土豆)"

On spare time, I am a lover of photography and rock music.
