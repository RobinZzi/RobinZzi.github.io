Research Experience
======
## Genomics & Bioinformatics  
**Westlake University**  
**Advisor:** Prof. Yanxiao Zhang  
*Lab of Computational and Functional Genomics*  
*Jan. 2022 - Present*  
- Performed integrated analysis of transposon expression level, DNA methylation level, and mutation information for each tumor type in the TCGA data.  
- Worked on multi-omics (scRNA + scWGBS) data from a set of HCC patients, identified certain hypo-methylation area regions in certain unique patient lesions, validated two potential DNA methylation regulators in HCC.  

## Immunity & Bioinformatics  
**USTC**  
**Advisor:** Prof. Wen Pan  
*Lab of Tumor Regulation and Epigenetics*  
*June 2019 - Dec. 2021*  
- Found a new N1-histidine methylation and its interactant, confirmed its function in tumor growth.  
- Confirmed the location of a kind of neurotransmitter receptor in the gut.  
- Collected bladder cancer samples from the affiliated hospital of USTC for single-cell RNA-seq.  
- Responsible for bioinformatics consulting and analysis for other lab members.  

## Synthetic Biology  
**Team-USTC, iGEM - International Genetically Engineering Machine Competition (2017, 2018)**  
**Advisor:** Prof. Haiyan Liu  
*Nov. 2016 - Nov. 2019*  
- Proposed building a photo-electro-bio universal reduction reaction catalysis system in *E. coli* (2017).  
- Proposed modifying-allowed-protein decorated bacterial cellulose for multi-functional air filters and in-situ grown ultrathin bacterial cellulose decorated with cellulose-binding domain linking targeting protein produced by *E. coli* (2018).  
- Presented our results at the international Jamboree in Boston.
